Message generator program.


Goal of the program:

Each time a user runs the program they will recieve a new random message. 


It should make use of a few different arrays that store strings that can be randomly put into different sections of the code.

It should make use of three random inspirational remarks that build upon one another in strange and funny ways. 

It should take three seperate parts of a potentially inspirational statment 

A start: "Never give up,"

A middle: "if you never give up,"

An end: "you will never know defeat."

Some of these might come out as nonsensical and weird, but that simply adds to the fun randomised element of it. It might even come through as oddly inspiring.


This should not take more than a couple of days. But I will set a deadline for 5 days. So it needs to be done by Dec 31st 2024.

After being done I will go through the tutorial code to see how they solved it and probably save it locally next to this file to make it easy to compare.
